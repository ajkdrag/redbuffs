Fine-grained embeddings refer to the practice of representing text at a detailed level by generating embeddings (dense vector representations) for individual tokens (words or subword units) _rather than for entire sentences or documents_.

> Instead of summarizing an entire document or query into a single vector (coarse-grained), fine-grained embeddings preserve the contextual nuances of each token within its sequence.
