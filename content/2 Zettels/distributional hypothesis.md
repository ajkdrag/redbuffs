> The distributional hypothesis is a linguistic theory that states that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings: 

This is based on the idea (by Firth in 1950s) that *words are characterized by the company they keep*. For example, words like "whale" and "dolphin" are often found near words like "ocean", "sea", "animal", and "fish". In [[distributional semantics\|distributional semantics]], the similarity between two words is calculated by comparing the similarity between their vectors (e.g. dot product).
