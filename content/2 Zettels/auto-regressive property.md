The auto-regressive property refers to a model's ability to make predictions based on its own previous outputs or historical values. More specifically, an auto-regressive model predicts the current value based on past values in a sequence.

$$
P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = P(x_1) \times P(x_3 \mid x_1,x_2) \times \ldots \times P(x_n \mid x_1,...,x_{nâ‚‹1})
$$

Common Applications:
- Language Models (like [[3 Topics/GPT\|GPT]])
- Time Series Prediction
- Speech Generation
- Music Generation

> [!Example]
> **Input**: `The cat sits on`
> **Step 1**: Predict `the` based on `The cat sits on`
> **Step 2**: Predict `mat` based on `The cat sits on the`
> **Result**: `The cat sits on the mat`

This property is well suited for generative tasks, but can be slow (one output at a time) and suffer from error accumulation.
